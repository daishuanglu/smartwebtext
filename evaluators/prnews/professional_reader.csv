These naturally occurring or modified viruses are a potent new weapon against cancer, according to recent reports on this growing market. The reports actually reveal that: ""… since the late 1800s, doctors have observed that some patients with cancer go into remission, if only temporarily, after a viral infection. Although the notion of using viruses in cancer therapy is old, the science only began to move forward in the 1990s with advances in genetic engineering technology with another shift around 2005, as people began to realize the true value of viruses in cancer therapy is in immunotherapy. When an oncolytic virus infects a tumor cell, it makes copies of itself until the cell bursts. The dying cancer cell releases tumor antigens and/or danger signals, which can change the tumor microenvironment to change an immunologically ""cold"" tumor (lacking T cells) into a ""hot"" tumor (influx of a multitude of immune cells and cytokines). Oncolytic viruses are alerting the immune system that something is wrong. This can lead to an immune response against nearby tumor cells (a local response) or tumor cells in other parts of the body (a systemic response).""     Active biotech and pharma companies in the markets this week include Oncolytics Biotech® Inc. (NASDAQ: ONCY) (TSX: ONC), Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOTH), ADMA Biologics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADMA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Aytu BioScience, Inc.
