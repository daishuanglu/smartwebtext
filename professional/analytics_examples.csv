Papa Gino's," IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Boston-area based pizza chain Papa Gino's has turned to IBM business analytics software to help better meet customer expectations for on-time, anywhere pizza deliveries in 30 minutes or less -- with food ordering capabilities now available through a new iPhone application.        Analytics has given Papa Gino's increased visibility into the performance of its online customer loyalty campaign, which has recently boasted a 50 percent increase in the total of an average order.

As a result, Papa Gino's can tailor its mobile commerce campaign more effectively to help increase both the average ticket price as well as ordering frequency.
